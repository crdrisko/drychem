# C++ Units

This project contains a unit converter written in C++ designed to be extendable with a number of interfaces. Currently, the public API of the project is in the development stage, but I hope to add a command line interface (CLI), graphical user interface (GUI), and web application very soon. Each of these interfaces will serve to help my software development skills by focusing on a singular project I can continue to enhance as I learn more.

## Building and Installing

To build the cpp-units libraries there are a few options that can be specified when building with `cmake`, these are discussed here:

- `units_build_all`

  Libraries, unit tests, and code samples will all be built. This option should be used if you don't want to install the tests and samples of only the cpp-units portion of the larger drychem repository. Otherwise, use the `chem_build_all` option.

  *Note:* The cpp-units libraries will be installed regardless, becasue the cpp-units library depends on them.

- `units_build_tests`

  If you're interested in building the unit tests but don't care about the examples that accompany the project, this option will build the cpp-units library and the tests.

  *Note:* Only the libraries will be installed.

- `units_build_samples`

  If you're interested in building the examples but don't care about the unit tests that accompany the project, this option will build the cpp-units library and the samples.

  *Note:* Only the libraries will be installed.

## C++ Libraries

The libraries included in this project include the following, and more information can be found in the specific libraries documentation:

- [Math](libs/...)
- [Types](libs/...)

The following tree diagram shows how a sample library, `library1`, would be organized in the API:

```bash
.
├── include
│   └── cpp-units
│       ├── library1
│       │   └── ...
│       ├── library1.hpp
│       └── ...
├── libs
│   └── library1
│       ├── docs
│       │   └── ...
│       ├── samples
│       │   └── ...
│       └── tests
│           ├── testAllLibrary1Functions.cpp
│           └── ...
└── src
    ├── library1
    |    └── ...
    └── ...
```

The `libs` directory contains information about the specific library, such as the documentation, example code samples, and unit tests. The `include/cpp-units` directory is where the header files for the library are stored. Note that the `libraryName.hpp` file serves as the public API of the library and should be `#include`'d in a user's project. The files in the `libraryName` directory contain the internal implementation details and are subject to change without notice.
