# Errors

The error handling library of the Common-Utilities project consists of functions and classes dedicated to error and exception handling. Since these types of events occur in virtually every project imaginable, it has proved useful collecting these functions in a single place.

## Getting Started

All the functions and classes belonging to the errors library are wrapped in the namespace `DryChem`. Alternatively, these functions and classes also have their own nested namespace in the `CppUtils` namespace, which can be called as `CppUtils::Errors`. While either can be used, `DryChem` is preferred to provide a uniform interface for all portions of the library. The following line can be included in any user project to provide access to the errors library:

```C++
#include <common-utils/errors.hpp>
```

## Features

### Exception Handling

- [Fatal Exception:](../../../include/common-utils/errors/exceptions/fatalException.hpp)

  This library provides an exception handling class: `CppUtils::Errors::FatalException` which derives from `std::exception`, and because of this, it can be caught by statements like the following:

  ```C++
  catch (const std::exception& e)
  {
      std::cerr << e.what() << std::endl;
  }
  ```

  However, if we throw an additional `FatalException` in this catch block (see [example](../samples/fibonacciExample.cpp)), we can customize the error messages and handle the exception based on whether it is fatal or not. The information we throw, via our `FatalException` constructor, includes the name of the program where the exception originated, the error message itself, along with the file name and line number of where the error originated. These last two pieces of information can be passed to the constructor using the `__FILE__` and `__LINE__` macros, respectively.

  The `FatalException` class delegates its error handling to a separate utility function (discussed next) when the user invokes `handleErrorWithMessage()`. Because this exception type is deemed fatal, a verbose error message will be printed and `std::exit()` will be called.

### Error Handling Utilities

- [Convience Types and Traits:](../../../include/common-utils/errors/utils/errorTypes.hpp)

  In the way of error handling, the Common-Utilities project defines two types of error severity: Warning and Fatal. These designations are defined as an enum class, `ErrorSeverity`, and are used to template the main function responsible for handling errors. Some type traits are provided as well which allow for compile-time determination of the level of severity our functions are dealing with. Some convenience type aliases and lambda functions are also defined to enhance code readability.

- [Error Handling:](../../../include/common-utils/errors/utils/errorHandling.hpp)

  The `printErrorMessage()` function template is a helper function for the `FatalException` class but can be called directly if needed. Depending on the error severity, the function will either print a warning to STDERR or print the supplied message and exit. `printFatalErrorMessage()` exists as a convience function for a fatal error so template parameters don't need to be explicitly writen.

## Working Example

For working examples of how to use the library, refer to the [testing](../tests) and/or [samples](../samples) directories, which together provide a comprehensive overview of the library's usage.

To build and run the code samples for the error library, one should include the `utils_build_samples=ON` option to the CMake instructions. Similarly, to build and run the unit tests for the individual error functions, one should include the `utils_build_tests=ON` option, as shown in the code below:

```bash
cmake ../drychem/. -Dutils_build_samples=ON -Dutils_build_tests=ON
make

## Run the error library's samples ##
cd bin/samples
./fibonacciExample

## Run the error library's unit tests ##
cd ../tests
./testAllErrorFunctions
```

*NOTE: The samples and tests will not be installed with the rest of the library. They exist only to extend the documentation and help the user navigate the library.*
